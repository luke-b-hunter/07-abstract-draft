# Visual style for a made up political party

* For my thesis project I decided to create a visual style for my own mande up frivolous political party. Political satire has it’s own history, that hasn’t been examined properly and because of it’s small effectiveness amd influence in politics, it has mostly remained forgotten in our society. And so a majority of people can barely remember any frivolous parties, despite there being already a few throughout political history, despite the tradition of humorouss way of seeing life being deeply engraved in Czech mentality, starting with the Czech writer Jaroslav Hasek and so it makes sense to continue with that tradition in my thesis project. The aim of this thesis is to introduce political satire through my own political movement and it's visual style. The tradition of humorouss way of seeing life is deeply engraved in Czech mentality, starting with the Czech writer Jaroslav Hasek and his party called The Party of Moderate Progress Within the Bounds of the Law, and so it makes sense to continue with that tradition in my thesis project. 


* The main sources will be a comprehensive research of other frivolous parties, research of logos of existing Czech political parties, political and marketing literature
