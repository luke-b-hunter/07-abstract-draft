# Visual style for a made up political party

* For my thesis project I decided to create a visual style for my own mande up frivolous political party. Political satire has it’s own history, that hasn’t been examined properly and because of it’s small effectiveness amd influence in politics, it has mostly remained forgotten in our society. And so a majority of people can barely remember any frivolous parties, despite there being already a few throughout political history. There is a tradition of humorouss way of seeing life, that is deeply engraved in Czech mentality, starting with the Czech writer Jaroslav Hasek and so it makes sense to continue with that tradition in my thesis project.

*  The aim of this thesis is to introduce political satire through my own personal movement and it's visual style. The tradition of humorous way of seeing life is deeply engraved in Czech mentality, starting with the Czech writer Jaroslav Hasek and his party called The Party of Moderate Progress Within the Bounds of the Law, and so it makes sense to continue with that tradition in my thesis project. 

* The main sources is a comprehensive research of other frivolous parties and a research of logos of existing poltitical movements and political and marketing literature. In my thesis, I'm researching the way on how other frivolous parties functioned and communicated and from that I'm deducing my own project. I'm also woking with current geogpolitical situations in the world that are crucial for the creation of my platform. In my theoretical part I'm taking a slight inspiration from other frivolous parties styles but essentialy creating my own visual assets. 

* The goal is to create a visual design for my own political party. This party should be flexible in a way, where it can react to other political problems, the routes it can take are many. The party can cooperate with other frivolous parties or it can turn into a real political party.
